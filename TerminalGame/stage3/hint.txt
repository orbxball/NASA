just create 100 files named '1', '2', '3'...., '100',
for each file:
    * if the file name "i" is an odd number, it should has a single number i as its content.
    * if the file name "i" is an even number, it sould has a single number i*2 as its content.

After the creation of files, run "getFlag" and you can get the flag.
