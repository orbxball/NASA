write an shell script "biggerNum.sh" to help Amy compare the numbers in files.

input format:
    ./biggerNum.sh [FILE_NAME_1] [FILE_NAME_2] [LINE_NUMBER]

FILE_NAME_1, FILE_NAME_2 are two file names, each file contains multiple integers in it, one of a line.

output format:
    compare the numbers in LINE_NUMBERth line of each file, print the bigger one.

example:
    fileA   fileB
--------------------
    1       2
    3       4
    5       4
    7       6

if user run "./biggerNum.sh fileA fileB 3", you should print "5".

When you finished, just run "./amy" and she will give you the flag.

*please make sure the file permission is properly set.
